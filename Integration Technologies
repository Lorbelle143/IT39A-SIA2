**Goal**  
The redesigned cloud computing curriculum aims to equip students with practical and theoretical knowledge aligned with industry standards. The focus is on fostering employability by teaching skills like scalability, virtualization, data analytics, and high-performance computing through AWS Academy resources.  

**Role**  
Students act as aspiring cloud computing professionals, solving real-world challenges using cloud technologies. They engage in hands-on labs and assessments that replicate tasks encountered in professional IT environments, such as designing scalable systems and analyzing big data.  

**Audience**  
The audience includes cloud computing employers, academic institutions, governments, and technology providers like AWS. Students showcase their skills and readiness to meet industry demands to these stakeholders.  

**Situation**  
Students work in realistic scenarios where cloud computing plays a critical role in addressing technological and business challenges. They apply skills in virtualization, distributed computing, and data analytics to solve tasks reflective of industry needs.  

**Product or Performance**  
Students create practical outputs such as prototypes, simulations, or analytical reports. Using AWS Academy tools, they demonstrate their ability to implement, troubleshoot, and manage cloud-based systems effectively.

**Introduction**  
With rising tuition costs, higher education institutions face increasing pressure to deliver value through employability-focused curricula. This report examines the integration of AWS Academy resources into a cloud computing module to enhance studentsâ€™ theoretical understanding and practical skills.

**Summary of Key Findings**  
The redesigned curriculum incorporated AWS Academy Cloud Foundations, featuring hands-on labs, videos, and white papers aligned with industry standards. Students gained exposure to best practices in cloud computing, career pathways, and internship opportunities through collaboration with AWS experts.

**Critical Analysis**  
The collaboration with AWS Academy aligns educational outcomes with industry needs by offering hands-on labs and certification opportunities (e.g., AWS Cloud Practitioner). However, the model's sustainability may be challenged due to reliance on an industry partner, and its findings are limited to one institution and domain.

**Integration and Synthesis**  
Integrating theoretical and practical learning adds significant value, making this model beneficial. Expanding partnerships to other industries and disciplines, such as data analytics and cybersecurity, could further enhance its impact.

**Conclusion**  
This initiative serves as a benchmark for creating employability-focused curricula. By combining theory with practical industry experience, higher education institutions can better prepare students for the workforce. Future efforts should diversify industry collaborations and evaluate long-term outcomes for broader applicability and sustainability.
